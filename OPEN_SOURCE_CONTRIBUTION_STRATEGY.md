## 🎯 Interview Preparation

### How to Talk About Contributions
- **STAR Method**: Situation, Task, Action, Result
- **Technical Depth**: Explain the code changes
- **Collaboration**: Describe working with maintainers
- **Learning**: What you gained from the experience
- **Impact**: How your contribution helped the project

### Example Interview Answers

**Question**: "Tell me about your open source contributions."

**Answer**:
> "I contributed to the Flask project by improving their authentication documentation. I noticed the docs were unclear about session management, so I submitted a PR that added detailed examples and clarified the workflow. The maintainers provided feedback on my writing style, and after two iterations, the PR was merged. This experience taught me how to work with established codebases and the importance of clear documentation."

**Question**: "What was challenging about open source?"

**Answer**:
> "The most challenging aspect was understanding the project's architecture and coding standards. For my first bug fix in the Requests library, I spent several hours reading the codebase and existing tests before making my changes. I learned the value of thorough testing and how professional projects maintain quality through rigorous review processes."
