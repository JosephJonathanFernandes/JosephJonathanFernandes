    "Code_Review": "AI-assisted analysis for potential bugs and improvements",
    "Learning": "Quick exploration of new concepts and best practices",
    "Documentation": "Generate comprehensive docs, then refine for clarity",
    "Debugging": "AI helps identify patterns and suggest solutions",
    "Architecture": "Brainstorm designs and validate approaches with AI",
    "Productivity": "Automate repetitive tasks while maintaining code quality"
}

# Philosophy: AI as a powerful tool, human as the architect
```

**Key Principle:** AI tools **amplify** my capabilities, but I always understand the code I write and maintain full control over the implementation.
