# 🚀 GitHub Profile Improvement Plan - 30 Day Challenge

## 🎯 Overall Goal
Transform your GitHub profile from "strong student" to "exceptional hire-ready candidate" by improving signal-to-noise ratio, documentation quality, and demonstrating production engineering skills.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### ✅ Strengths (Keep & Enhance)
- **Visteon Internship**: Strong industry experience with AUTOSAR, MISRA-C, VectorCast
- **Live Projects**: Exoscope with live demo shows deployment capability
- **Tech Stack**: Good breadth from embedded to web to AI/ML
- **Competitive Achievements**: Hackathon wins demonstrate teamwork and delivery
- **Academic Foundation**: 9.778 CGPA shows consistency

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
- **Repository Count**: 92 repos suggests quantity over quality
- **Documentation Depth**: READMEs need more technical detail
